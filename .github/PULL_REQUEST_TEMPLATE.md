Please make sure that you have read and followed the ["add your key to the list"](README.md#Adding-your-key-to-this-list) section in the README. Here's a checklist for your PR:

- [ ] You **HAVE NOT** edited the `active.tsv` or `revoked.tsv` files in the root folder of this repository. These lists are automatically generated to avoid merge conflicts and should not be touched. 
- [ ] You have **ONLY** made additions and changes to files in your `KEYS/YOUR_CALLSIGN` folder.

All requests are reviewed by a human (at least for now). I'll do my best to be prompt with the merge!
